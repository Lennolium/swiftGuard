"""
worker.py: This module implements the main worker object/loop, which is
a subclass of QObject. It guards the usb ports and detects manipulation.
It also executes the user defined action, if a manipulation is detected.
The worker is started by the main application, runs in a separate thread
and is stopped if the user defuses the countdown.

NOTE: You can use this module standalone without the GUI. Just run this
script in terminal. For changing settings and allowing devices, have a
look in ~/Library/Preferences/swiftguard/swiftguard.ini.

WHITELIST: Insert your USB device, open a terminal and run the command:
'system_profiler SPUSBDataType -xml -detailLevel mini'.

Search your device and copy 'vendor_id', 'product_id' (both without 0x),
serial_num and _name. Insert them in the whitelist section of the config
file using the following format:
('vendor_id', 'product_id', 'serial_num', '_name')

Separate multiple devices with a comma and a space. Example:
devices = ('apple_vendor_id', '12a8', '000012345ABCD123456789',
'iPhone 13 Pro'), ('0123', '6110', '00001234ABCDE123', 'UsbStick')

For Apple devices, use the full name. Example: iPhone -> iPhone 13 Pro.
A list of all full names can be found in the helpers.py file.

ALTERNATIVE: Insert USB device, start the application (GUI) and add the
device to the whitelist in the settings menu. Close the application and
start this script. The device should be allowed now.
