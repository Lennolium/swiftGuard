# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you wish to report a security vulnerability -- thank you! -- I ask
that you follow the following process.

Please report security vulnerabilities by filling out the following template:

```
- PROJECT: A URL to project's repository
- PUBLIC: Please let us know if this vulnerability has been made or discussed publicly already, and if
          so, please let us know where. 
- DESCRIPTION: Please provide precise description of the security vulnerability you have found with as
               much information as you are able and willing to provide.
```

Please send the above info, along with any other information you feel
is pertinent to: [lennart-haack@mail.de](mailto:lennart-haack@mail.de?subject=%5BSECURITY%20VULN%5D&body=Hello%20Lennart%2C%0A%0A)

In addition, you may request that the project provide you a patched
release in advance of the release announcement, however, I can not
guarantee that such information will be provided to you in advance of
the public release and announcement.
